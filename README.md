# **X/Shell: Kernel-Level Shell Interaction for Linux**

**XShell** is a lightweight, kernel-level Linux shell application designed to interact directly with the operating systemâ€™s kernel, bypassing traditional shells like Bash. It features a GUI built using GTK, offering an intuitive interface for performing system-level operations. This project demonstrates expertise in system programming, Linux kernel interaction, and advanced GUI development.

## **Key Technologies**

- **C Programming**: Core development in C, showcasing system-level programming skills, memory management, and efficient file I/O handling.
- **Linux Kernel Interaction**: Uses direct system calls (`execve`, `fork`, etc.) to interact with the kernel, bypassing intermediary shells.
- **GTK 3**: Modern GUI creation using GTK, enabling cross-platform graphical interfaces.
- **Command History**: Tracks previously executed commands with optimized data structures, highlighting algorithm design expertise.
- **Real-Time Output Rendering**: Non-blocking, real-time display of command output in the GUI, demonstrating multithreading and asynchronous programming.

## **Features**

### **1. Direct Kernel Interaction**
Performs core tasks like file manipulation, directory management, and process control by directly communicating with the Linux kernel.

### **2. Intuitive GUI**
- Built with GTK3 for a modern, user-friendly interface.
- Commands and outputs are displayed in an interactive terminal-like environment.

### **3. Command Set**
Implements essential system operations:
- `listmyDir`: List files in the current directory.
- `getInto <directory>`: Navigate to a specific directory.
- `createFile <file_name>`: Create a new file.
- `removeFile <file_name>`: Delete a file.
- `makeDir <directory_name>`: Create a new directory.
- `removeDir <directory_name>`: Remove an existing directory.
- `countFiles`: Count files in the current directory.
- `displayPwd`: Show the current working directory.
- `displayTime`: Display the current system time.
- `history`: View the last 100 executed commands.

### **4. Modular Architecture**
Encapsulates functionality in separate modules for scalability and maintainability.

### **5. Real-Time Output**
Displays command execution results instantly using non-blocking processes.
